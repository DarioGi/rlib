		<title>A little Terminology</title>
		<para>
			In addition to being a report writer, RLIB is also an interpreted language (like Basic and FOXPRO).  RLIB handles all memory
			management for you.  If you are familiar with FOXPRO, then you will feel at home with RLIB.  However, if you don't know
			foxpro see the function reference (symbol table) to see all of the functions available to you.  In a nutshell its pretty 
			powerful.  You can do stuff like this:
			<programlisting>
'hi' + ' ' + 'there' + database.stringfield
1+2*87+(7*2)/98.2/database.numberfield
dtos(database.somedatefield)-7
			</programlisting>
			RLIB has 3 data types that it uses internally. STRING, DATE, and NUMBER.  There are functions to turn datatypes
			into other datatypes, plus all sorts of other goodies.  Almost all parameters in the RLIB xml file are expressions. This
			means that the parameters are computed on the fly. The result must be a STRING, DATE, or NUMBER (usually STRING or NUMBER).
			In our examples you will see stuff like expN, expS, expD.  expN means number expressions, expS means a string expression, and
			expD means a date expression.
		</para>
		<tip><title>STRINGS are in single quotes</title>
		<para>
			Please note that STRINGS in rlib are between single quotes.  This is because XML uses double quotes.
		</para>
		</tip>
		<para>			
			lets take an example. 
		</para>
		<para>
		   The round function is defined as round(expN).  This means that it must be given a number to round.  
			In rlib you an do the following:
			<programlisting>
				round(7.2)
				round(7.2+33)
				round(val('7.2')*9/2)
			</programlisting>
			As long as it gets passed a expN.. got it? Good.  By the way,  val(expS) takes a string and turns it into a number.
		</para>
	</sect1>
	<sect1>
		<title>Fixed Point</title>
		<para>
			Numerical accuracy is important in RLIB, therefore all mathematical calculations are done with fixed point using 
			8 decimal places of accuracy.  As you might know, floating point operations in computing are inherently inaccurate. 
			It is especially true if you are looping through data doing computations.  Therefore, rlib uses FIXED POINT calculations 
			internally in order to preserve accuracy.  Note, all of this is internal to rlib, and you never have to worry about it
			when writing reports.			
		</para>
	</sect1>
	<sect1>
		<title>Data Sources</title>
		<para>
			RLIB has many data sources; databases, environment variables, rlib internal variables, and rlib user variables.
		</para>
		<para>
			The first query you give rlib is the main query. In the XML you can reference your fields as the field names without
			specifying the data source name ie (fld1+fld2).  For the main data source, just put the field names in from the result set.
			You can still reference by the "RESULT SET NAME". Refer to the api "rlib_add_query_as".
		</para>
		<tip><title>Note</title>
		<para>
			ALL Result set fields come into RLIB as STRINGs!
			you will have to frequently do VAL or FXPVAL. to turn them into numbers
		</para> 
		</tip>
		<para>
			All other queries are secondary queries. You <emphasis>must</emphasis> specify the data source name when you reference them. 
			ie (result.fld1+result.fld2)
		</para>
		<para>
			Environment variables are STRINGS coming from the environment that you can pick up to put on your report. If in php you had
			<programlisting>
				$start_date = "2003-01-01";
			</programlisting>
			In RLIB you reference thing as m.name.  So you would have
			<programlisting>
				m.start_date
			</programlisting>
		</para>
		<para>
			rlib has a few internal variables like pageno, lineno, detailcnt (detail line count). Reference them with  r.name. It
			would be r.pageno, r.lineno, and r.detailcnt in your code.  
			RLIB has one more variable r.value, which is the result of a "FIELD"'s expression.. This is good so say in the
			color field, you DON'T HAVE TO RECALCULATE THE VALUE, you can use the "POINTER" to the value in order to color the field.
			like if it is < 0 make it red, else make it black....
		</para>
		<para>
			Finally,  rlib variables (discussed below) are referenced with a r.name, where name is the name you gave them.
		</para>
		<para>
			So you could have an expression like this in rlib
			<programlisting>
				str((val(m.some_environment_value)+r.some_sum_value*val(field1)),7,2) + " hi"
			</programlisting>
		</para>

		<title>Report Layout</title>
		<para>
			Reports are laid out into logical sections.
		</para>
		<para>
			<emphasis>Report Header</emphasis> - Appears at the top of the first page of a report.  Report headers commonly have information
			such as organization name.
		</para>
		<para>
			<emphasis>Page Header</emphasis> - Appears at the top of every page except the first page, where it appears below
			the Report Header. Page headers commonly list the report name.
		</para>
		<para>
			<emphasis>Page Footer</emphasis> - Appears at the bottom of each page.  Page number is commonly found on Page Footers.
		</para>
		<para>
			<emphasis>Report Footer</emphasis> - Appears on the last page below the last element of data.  Report Data Totals are found
			in the Report Footer
		</para>
		<para>
			<emphasis>Data Lines</emphasis> - Appear for each row of data you have in your main result set.
		</para>
		<para>
			<emphasis>Break Header(s)</emphasis> - A header record for your data breaks appear before the Data Lines 
			that are in the break sub section.
		</para>
		<para>
			<emphasis>Break Footers(s)</emphasis> - Appear below the data lines for the break sub section.  Might include sub totals
			for the data subsection.
		</para>

		<para>
			The following 2 images were generated from RLIB.  It shows Page Headers, Report Headers, Page Footers, Report Footers,
			and Data Lines.  The image also demonstrates more advanced concepts in RLIB such as format strings, color, and background color.
			Don't worry about that now.

		<title>Breaks Explained</title>
		<para>
			It is often necessary to group data on a report in logical sections.  For example imagine a report with a data scope of 
			a list of stores.  The stores are part of a hierarchy.  In this example the hierarchy could be 4 levels deep. 
			ie: "District, Market, Region, Another Level".  It would be wasteful to have 4 columns on a report showing the same information
			over and over again.  If the names were 20 characters long we would have just wasted at least 80 columns on our report.
			Aside from wasting space, it is often necessary to produce sub totals on groups of data in a report.  Breaks are good for
			this also.  The following example is a report that is breaking on a hierarchy schema.  There are count and amount subtotals
			for each break.  It should also be noted here that RLIB knows how much room is left on a page.  It will not start a break at
			the bottom of a page if at least 1 data line will fit.  Instead it will end the page and start the break on the next page.
		</para>

		<para>
			Note the the break headers here are "District A", "Market a". The break footers are the maroon color and also
			have "SUB TOTAL" in the date column.

		<title>Report Variables</title>
		<para>
			Report Variables are are expressions rlib evaulates for every detail line, and resets automatically if asked to
			on breaks.  Report variables are useful things like COUNT, SUM, AVG, HIGHEST, LOWEST.  You may also use report
			variables to simplify expressions that will be used (normally more than once) in other calculations.  To do this
			use the type EXPRESSION.  Report variable can be "RESET" on the event of a BREAK (this does not apply to EXPRESSION)

		<title>Defining a Report</title>
		<para>
			RLIB reports are defined in the RLIB xml file.  The XML file encompases all topics discussed above.  Here is
			a sample XML file.

		<para>
			headernewpage = [yes/no] Yes is default. The break header will always appear on the top of every page
		</para>	
		<para>
			breaks have BreakHeader and BreakFooter and both contain output. ONE NICE FEATURE IN RLIB IS THAT WHEN A BREAK EVENT

		</para>	
		<para>
			Breaks also have BreakFields. An expression on how it breaks. There can be more then one and 
			it has a value. The value is an expression.
